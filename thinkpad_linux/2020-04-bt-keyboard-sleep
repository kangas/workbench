Thinkpad bluetooth keyboard has recently started going to sleep after ~1 min idle time.
Very annoying!

Fiddling around a bit, it seems fixed when this setting is active:

	$ hciconfig hci0 inqtype
	hci0:	Type: Primary  Bus: USB
		BD Address: A0:88:69:E1:CE:BC  ACL MTU: 1021:4  SCO MTU: 96:6
		Inquiry scan type: Standard Inquiry Scan

I think I activated it via:

	$ sudo hcitool spinq

		spinq	Start periodic inquiry

What was the setting before this? Not sure!

Another thing that "fixed" it was to leave "bluetoothctl" running in a terminal.

Here is the BT ID of my home keyboard:

Try watching `journalctl -f` when this occurs. I see the following now which looks fishy...
disconnect at :40, reconnect at :58?

After this happened a few more times today I remembered about "powertop".
So I ran powertop and looked at "Tunables", saw several entries like

	>> Good          Autosuspend for USB device xHCI Host Controller [usb3]

I switched those to "Bad" meaning

	echo 'on' > '/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/power/control'

But this didn't seem to stop disconnects.
I then typed "bluetooth" and "man bluetooth". I noticed a related utility called "tlp" and "tlp-stat" related to power management.

    NAME
       tlp - apply laptop power saving settings

    DESCRIPTION
       Apply power saving settings manually and control ThinkPad battery features.


	$ sudo tlp-stat
	[sudo] password for kangas: 
	--- TLP 1.1 --------------------------------------------

	+++ Configured Settings: /etc/default/tlp
	...
	USB_BLACKLIST_BTUSB=1    # (kangas)

Oh really? Did I adjust that previously?
At every disconnect event, the first entry shown by journalctl is

	Apr 15 21:01:20 qwghlm acpid[1344]: input device has been disconnected, fd 22

acpid is just a messenger, it seems:

    NAME
       acpid - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event daemon

    DESCRIPTION
       acpid  is  designed  to notify user-space programs of ACPI events.  acpid should be started during the system boot, and will run as a background process, by default.  It will

Looks like I can run "acpi_listen" to receive the same events (I presume).

Looks like /sys/class/power_supply has some interesting controls

	$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/hid-90:7f:61:46:6c:d4-battery/model_name

	runtime_active_time   wakeup                  wakeup_expire_count

I can read all entries there except "autosuspend_delay_ms". I wonder why?

I installed "Bluetooth Manager" today aka "blueman", a GUI config interface for Bluetooth.
Shows nothing out of the ordinary.

Maybe it's been a Linux kernel bug this whole time?

Recall that I am running Linux qwghlm 5.3.0-46-generic
I _could_ switch back to 4.15 and try that.

During some interrupt events today i noticed

- The keyboard isn't going to sleep. It happened a few times while I was typing today.
- It isn't Bluetooth interference. I ran this in a window today...

	while true; do hcitool lq 90:7F:61:46:6C:D4 | grep -v "Link quality: 255"; sleep 1; done

the only output was

	Not connected.
	Not connected.
	Not connected.
	Not connected.
	Not connected.

A new 5.3.0 kernel just became available, Version 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2
Changes since Version 5.3.0-46.38~18.04.1 include...

    - xhci: Force Maximum Packet size for Full-speed bulk devices to valid range.
    - xhci: fix runtime pm enabling for quirky Intel hosts
    - xhci: Fix memory leak when caching protocol extended capability PSI tables -
      take 2
    - usb: host: xhci: update event ring dequeue pointer on purpose
    - xhci: apply XHCI_PME_STUCK_QUIRK to Intel Comet Lake platforms

Comet Lake has only been available since 2019 so that's not my machine
