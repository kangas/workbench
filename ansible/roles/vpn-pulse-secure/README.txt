Pulse Secure VPN - client setup

https://www.pulsesecure.net/

Pulse Secure was formerly Junos Pulse from Juniper Networks.

The Linux client works reasonably well but it is annoying to download. It is not available on any public URL. Instead, you must use the following web form to request a download link.

As of October 2020, this web form does not work on Firefox!! But it does work with Chrome.

Required information:

- First name
- Last name
- Business email
- Country
- State
- Postal Code

After a successful form submission, you should then receive an email with subject "[trial details] Pulse Client". Download links inside include:

- Ubuntu/Debian 64 Bit Installer
- CentOS/RHEL 64 Bit Installer
- MD5

Each download link is of the form:
