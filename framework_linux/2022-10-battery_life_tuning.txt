> I was having trouble hitting PC10, but then I found out it works after a reboot/fresh boot but not after suspending. It always works during suspend, but after the first suspend, it no longer worked in normal use until the next power cycle.

Excellent catch! I knew that I had hit C10 once or twice in the past, but couldn’t seem to replicate those results reliably. This explains it.

For those who need it spelled out more: I verified the fix by following these steps:

    Reboot
    Verify hitting C10 with powertop
    Suspend, then re-awaken
    Verify not hitting C10

I then added nvme.noacpi=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT (see here 62 for how to do that) and repeated the procedure above. After the change, step (4) shows that I’m getting to C10 even after a suspend.
